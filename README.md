# 🧠 Enhancing Text Analytics Data Quality with NLP

A robust NLP-powered pipeline to clean, enrich, and analyze textual data with the aim of improving data quality, insight generation, and topic understanding using state-of-the-art natural language processing techniques.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods can significantly enhance the quality of textual datasets. The core focus is on preprocessing, cleaning, and enriching text data to prepare it for downstream tasks such as sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and clustering.

---

## 🚀 Key Features

- ✅ **Text Cleaning**: Removes noise such as URLs, mentions, numbers, special characters, emojis, and filler words (e.g., “umm”, “uh”).
- ✅ **Contraction Expansion**: Expands contractions like *"don't"* to *"do not"*.
- ✅ **Spelling & Grammar Correction**: Uses `TextBlob` to correct common typos and grammatical issues.
- ✅ **Stopword Removal & Lemmatization**: Improves semantic clarity of text.
- ✅ **NER & POS Tagging**: Named Entity Recognition and Part-of-Speech tagging using spaCy.
- ✅ **Sentiment Analysis**: Polarity and subjectivity scoring using VADER.
- ✅ **Topic Modeling**: Extracts hidden topics using LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation).
- ✅ **KMeans Clustering**: Groups similar texts into clusters.
- ✅ **Word Cloud & Top Words**: Visual representation of the most frequent words.
- ✅ **Comprehensive Report Generation**: Outputs key metrics and insights to a `.txt` file.
